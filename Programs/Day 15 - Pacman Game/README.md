## Introduction

This Python script simulates the iconic Pacman game. It uses the Turtle graphics library for rendering the game graphics and handling user input. The game features Pacman and ghosts, where the player controls Pacman and aims to collect all the dots while avoiding the ghosts.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (Right, Left, Up, Down) to control Pacman's movement.
- Navigate Pacman to eat all the dots on the board.
- Beware of the ghosts! If a ghost touches Pacman, the game ends.
- The game keeps track of your score, which increases with each dot you eat.
