Welcome to my **"100 Days, 100 Programs"** challenge repository! Here, I will be sharing the programs I create as part of this challenge. Each day, I will be working on a different program, exploring various programming languages and building practical applications.

## Motivation

The purpose of this challenge is to enhance my programming skills, explore different programming languages and frameworks, and create useful and interesting programs along the way. By challenging myself to build a new program every day, I aim to sharpen my problem-solving abilities, expand my knowledge, and have a collection of diverse projects to showcase my learning journey.
